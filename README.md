# Automatic_Segmentation_Classification_CODE_TFG_MartaBorrull


Acute Pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas. This happens when digestive juices or enzymes attack the pancreas. 
In Spain, this disease is range with 49,3 cases per 100 000 population and this involves to increase the number of hospitalize patients because of this pathology.
For this reason, using technologies that are on the rise nowadays as Deep Learning and Neural Networks, we implemented some tools that can help medical staff to be less time-consume and increase their efficiency when they diagnose a patient. With the collaboration of the Vall dâ€™Hebron University Hospital, that has provided the MRIs from anonymised patients, it has been realized a segmentation model that detects and resects the pancreas, and a classifier that predict if a patient has this disease by using images and medical variables or labels. These networks can help to monitor and evaluate the evolution of the patients with pancreatitis.
